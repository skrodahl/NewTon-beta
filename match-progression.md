# Corrected Double Elimination Progression Tables

## Key Principles

1. **Mirroring Rule**: When players move from Frontside to Backside:
   - Top half of frontside losers → Bottom half of backside
   - Bottom half of frontside losers → Top half of backside

2. **Backside Internal Progression**: Winners advance normally within backside (no mirroring)

3. **Timing**: Frontside round N losers enter backside at round N (mixed with backside round N-1 winners)

## Validation Notes

### 8-Player Example Verification
Starting with 8 players in FS Round 1:
- **FS-1-1 & FS-1-2** losers → **BS-1-2** (mirrored: top FS → bottom BS)
- **FS-1-3 & FS-1-4** losers → **BS-1-1** (mirrored: bottom FS → top BS)

In BS Round 2:
- **BS-1-1 winner** meets **FS-2-2 loser** in **BS-2-1**
- **BS-1-2 winner** meets **FS-2-1 loser** in **BS-2-2**

This ensures proper mirroring throughout and no player gets an unfair advantage.

### Key Corrections Made
1. **Fixed mirroring**: Frontside top/bottom properly maps to backside bottom/top
2. **Consistent internal progression**: Backside winners advance normally
3. **Proper timing**: Frontside round N losers enter backside round N
4. **Eliminated placement order**: Consistent ranking based on elimination round
