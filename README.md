# NewTon Tournament Manager - Beta
**This version is currently not working.** Work is ongoing to make the tournament management more resilient and less prone to operator mistakes.

**NewTon Tournament Manager** is a fully self-contained web app for running double-elimination darts tournaments.  
It runs entirely in your browser — no server, database, or installation required.

Simply download the repository, open `tournament.html`, and start managing your tournament.
